# Single-Server-Queue-Simulation-Using-Blum-Blum-Shub-Generator
In this project I apply a novel approach to managing waiting lines in queueing systems was explored, based on the findings of a recent paper. The enhancement of the classic M/M/1 queueing model by incorporating elements of the Blum-Blum-Shub algorithm, a renowned pseudorandom number generator, was the focus of the paper. This integration, termed the M/M/1-BBS model, was aimed at optimizing queue management and reducing the overall time spent in queues.
